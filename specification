# Functional Specification

## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to examine the relationship between the results of the PISA study over multiple years and the education investments of various countries and to visualize insights derived from this analysis.

## Requirements
- Data from the PISA study across multiple years is required to analyze student performance in different countries.
- Data on education investments from various countries over the same time period is required.
- The data must be in a suitable format that can be used for analysis and visualization purposes.

## Functionalities
- Importing and merging the data from the PISA study and education investments from various countries.
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data to prepare it for analysis.
- Conducting statistical analyses to examine the relationship between PISA results and education investments.
- Developing visualizations (e.g. charts, graphs, maps) to illustrate the findings.
- Interpreting the results and deriving conclusions.

## User Requirements
Users should be able to easily understand the visualizations and gain insights from the data. The user interface should be user-friendly and allow for navigation between different countries and years.

## Quality Requirements
- The data must be accurate and up-to-date to perform accurate analyses.
- Visualizations should be well-designed and provide clear insights.
- Results should be verifiable and reproducible to ensure the validity of the analysis.

## Deliverables
- A report summarizing the analysis findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
- A presentation highlighting the key results and visualizations of the project.

## Education Levels Descriptions

### ED02-8
**ISCED Level:** This category falls under ISCED 2011 which stands for the International Standard Classification of Education. Within ISCED 2011, ED02-8 represents the "Upper secondary education" level.
**Description:** Upper secondary education typically includes educational programs providing learning experiences that build on secondary education, preparing students for tertiary education or providing skills relevant to employment.
**Age Range:** Usually, students in upper secondary education are in the age range of around 15 to 18 years old, but this can vary depending on the country's education system.
**Example:** High school education leading to diplomas or certificates that are recognized for entry into tertiary education or vocational training programs can be considered as ED02-8.

### ED1
**ISCED Level:** ED1 corresponds to the "Primary education" level within ISCED 2011.
**Description:** Primary education is the first stage of formal education, typically beginning around the age of 5 or 6. It aims to provide fundamental skills such as literacy, numeracy, and basic knowledge about the world.
**Age Range:** Generally, primary education covers students from around age 6 to 11 or 12, again varying somewhat depending on the country's educational system.
**Example:** Elementary school education where students learn basic subjects such as mathematics, language arts, science, and social studies falls under ED1.
