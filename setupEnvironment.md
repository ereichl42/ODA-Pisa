# Environment Setup Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up your Python development environment for this project using Conda and pip. Choose the method that best suits your needs, whether you prefer using Conda for managing complex dependencies or pip for its straightforward package management.

## Option 1: Using Conda and `environment.yml`

Conda is a powerful tool that simplifies package and environment management. It is well-suited for projects that require handling complex dependencies, making it a popular choice in data science and computational projects.

### Prerequisites

- **Install Miniconda** or Anaconda:
  - Download and install Miniconda from the [official Conda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

### Creating the Environment

1. **Clone the project repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Create the Conda environment** using the `environment.yml` file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

3. **Activate the environment**:
   ```bash
   conda activate <env-name>
   ```

4. **Check the installation** by listing the installed packages:
   ```bash
   conda list
   ```

## Option 2: Using Pip and `requirements.txt`

Pip is the standard package manager for Python. It allows you to install and manage additional packages that are not included in the Python standard library.

### Prerequisites

- **Ensure Python is installed**:
  - Python can be installed from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Creating the Environment

1. **Clone the project repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended to avoid conflicts with other projects):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages** using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify the package installation**:
   ```bash
   pip list
   ```

## Conclusion

You now have a functional development environment tailored for this project using either Conda or pip. For any issues, refer to the [Conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) or the [pip user guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/).

If you need further assistance, please consult the project documentation, open an issue in the repository, or contact the project maintainer.
