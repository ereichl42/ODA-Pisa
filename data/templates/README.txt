The expenditure datasets are separated by type of metric (by GDP, in â‚¬,...) and by educational level (ED0 = primary schoo, ED1 = secondary...).
So there will be multiple files created of one dataset downloaded.
This helps to keep the data organized, and allows easier filtering, especially since we ware only interested in the data till the education level of age 15.
